## (Do NOT Lick)

This was an educational assignment, but the education was not so much D3 as it was getting four code bases to work together.  To that end, I think the Trilogy program is lacking in clarity on the challenges in doing that.  I spent more time on trying to get everything to run than I did on the assignment itself.

WONKY - 

I had so many problems getting this to work that I lost confidence that my code was functional and eventually downloaded a Github example from last year to see if it would work.  It didn't, so I knew that the problem was with the dynamics of running Python.   Eventually, I found a way to get it to work, but it was inconsistent with the way I had been running Flask apps previously,and successfully.  

I tried five or six different Heroku installs once I completed the main assignment, and the bonus.  I did not see that it was necessary to create a bonus.js file as the additional chart seemed to be naturally integrated with the pie and scatter charts, so I put in a single call to create the chart from the drop down selection, passing the WFREQ variable to the chart.  I don't think it was any harder than any other chart other than that the Trilogy chart had labels different than the way I did it.
